1. After each fold, 
print "==== Test Accuracy: %f ====" % (cv_acc)
print "Vector number: %d" % VecNum
will print accuracy and vector number in this fold. You need to save them.

2. After all folds,
print ConfMatrix
plot_confusion_matrix(get_scalar(ClassLabels), get_scalar(OverallValidate), normalize=True)
will print and plot the overall confusion matrix.
If you run code on a server without GUI, you may have to save what be printed and plot the matrix by yourself.

3. In main():
Ytrain, EstParametersArray, EstConfMatricesArray, ConfMatrix = MyCrossValidate(input_vec, label_vec, 5, {'type':'SVM'})
Please replace 'SVM' with 'RVM'.
Then you can run the code.
